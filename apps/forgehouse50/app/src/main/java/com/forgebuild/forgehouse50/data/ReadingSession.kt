/**
 * catchup_widget_links_v1 / ISSUE 2 — the catch-up reading engine.
 *
 * THE RULE (operator's final version, exactly):
 *  - On any day a user opens the app to read they are presented with AT MOST
 *    2 days' worth of reading — never more, regardless of backlog size.
 *  - Backlog is worked strictly chronologically (oldest missed day first),
 *    2 days at a time, until caught up to the present day.
 *  - NO hard cap on missed days: catch-up is always mechanically possible.
 *  - The only limit is arithmetic: if outstanding missed days exceed the
 *    calendar reading days remaining before the user's programme end date,
 *    they mathematically cannot finish inside the window. That is exposed as
 *    an honest STATUS, never a lockout; the user keeps reading regardless.
 *  - Interaction with the pre-existing 1-day read-ahead limit: read-ahead is
 *    available ONLY when the user has zero backlog; while any backlog exists
 *    the 2-day catch-up pacing takes precedence. Once caught up, normal
 *    single-day (with optional 1-day-ahead) behavior resumes.
 *
 * All derivations here are PURE (no I/O): the caller passes the progress +
 * today snapshots the app already fetches. Widget and UI share this engine so
 * the assignment on the home screen widget always matches the app.
